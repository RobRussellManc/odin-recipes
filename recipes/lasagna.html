    </div>
    <div class="steps">
        <h4>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté until softened (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add the minced meat and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato purée and cook for 1-2 minutes to deepen the flavour.</li>
            <li>Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it reduce for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Stir well.</li>
            <li>Simmer the sauce for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened and flavours have developed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Step 2: Prepare the Béchamel Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to form a roux.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Remove from heat.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
            <li>Spoon a layer of meat sauce into the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cover with a layer of lasagna sheets.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the pasta, followed by a sprinkle of grated Parmesan and mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers (meat sauce, pasta, béchamel, cheese) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of béchamel and a generous topping of cheese.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Step 4: Bake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil (to prevent the top from browning too quickly) and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
        </ol>
